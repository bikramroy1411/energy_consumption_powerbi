🌍 Optimizing Energy Consumption Dashboard Project

This project focuses on optimizing energy consumption for a multi-location company supplying water, electricity, and gas. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to drive informed decision-making and support sustainable energy practices.

🌟 Key Challenges

🔍 Monitor and manage energy consumption across diverse building types and locations.
📊 Identify trends, anomalies, and find improvement opportunities in energy usage.
💡 Ensure efficient operations and maximize cost-effectiveness for energy resources.
🚀 Solution Overview

I developed a Power BI dashboard with dedicated sections for water, electricity, and gas, each providing insights into:

Consumption Patterns 📈: Analyzed usage trends across buildings and over time to highlight outliers and seasonal patterns. For instance, water usage spiking in summer could prompt irrigation checks or leak detection.
Cost Analysis 💰: Tracked annual expenses and broke down costs by energy type and location. This highlighted areas with the highest expenses, revealing opportunities for cost-saving upgrades or supplier negotiations.
Interactive Features 🧩: Enabled users to explore patterns by building type, location, and timeframe with slicers and filters, allowing targeted analysis on high-consumption buildings.
🛠️ Technical Skills

Power Query 🔄: Used Power Query to clean and transform data from multiple sources into a unified format, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Data Modeling 🔗: Established relationships between tables to create a structured data model, reducing errors in calculations and visuals.
DAX Measures 📐: Created DAX calculations for KPIs critical to energy analysis, such as total cost, unit consumption per energy type, and efficiency ratios.
Data Visualization 📊: Designed clear visuals with Power BI’s tools, using conditional formatting to emphasize critical data like anomalies and areas requiring further investigation.
🔍 Actionable Insights

Water as the Dominant Resource 💧: Water accounted for 88.49% of total energy consumption with stable costs, suggesting conservation opportunities.
Decreasing Gas Consumption and Costs 📉: Noticed a declining trend in gas consumption and costs from 2016-2019. This reduction led to an analysis of potential influences:
Policy Initiatives 📃: Reviewed company policies promoting efficiency (e.g., appliance upgrades).
Infrastructure Improvements 🛠️: Evaluated building upgrades, such as better insulation, for their impact on energy efficiency.
Alternative Energy ☀️: Checked if the company moved to renewable sources, like solar, for gas-powered activities.
Additional Data Needs 🗂️: Found a need for data on building types and locations to enhance insights:
Benchmarking 📏: Compare similar building types to identify improvement opportunities within each category.
Location Analysis 🌎: Study energy consumption by region to correlate with weather and infrastructure, supporting targeted conservation strategies.
🌱 Impact

By leveraging Power BI and my data analysis skills, this project equips the company to make sustainable, data-driven decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving cost savings. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool to promote efficient, responsible energy use and to pave the way for a more sustainable future.
